          Here's a sampling of current and past projects to which I've

          Many projects involve propietary information or sensitive data. To
          protect the confidentiality and privacy of my clients and/or employers,
          most samples are generic representations of the deliverables produced.
          Any samples that contain actual work are from defunct companies with any

With the exception of one holdout, I presented them with story boards to illustrate how helper text could best benefit the specific needs of the end users.
